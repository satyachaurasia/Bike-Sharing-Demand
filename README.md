This dataset is available on Kaggle Webiste. First the data is analyzed and preprocessed so that it can be fed into ML models.

Two types of ML models are used for prediction. One is simpler Linear regression and other is Gradient Boosting Regression Model. 
Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). 

Gradeint Boosting uses many weak decision trees models in order to build a strong one.

The accuracy of Gradeient Boosting Regression is far better than simpler Linear Regression Model.
